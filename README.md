## Motivation

This quiz motivated me to slow down and take in each concept. I was able to learn how to pseudo code, in order to help me understand the process behind a site. I will be returning to complete this activity at a later time, to hone those skills. 

## Style

HTML, CSS, and JS 


## Credits

Shout out to the tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/riDzcEQbX6k"><bold>Build A Quiz App With JavaScript Tutorial</bold></a>. Which I followed step by step, in order to prepare for my next project, because I was not tecnically prepared for this one. I'm still working on mastering the timer and the local storage.
